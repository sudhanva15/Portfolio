# Image Generation Guide

This document contains the exact prompts and specifications for generating all portfolio visuals. Generate at **1920×1080** (16:9) or **1600×1067** (3:2) depending on aspect ratio noted, export as `.webp` for optimal performance.

## 1. Hero Visual (Home) — "Calm Mission Control"

**Target:** `/public/images/hero/mission-control.webp`  
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (1920×1080)  
**Alt Text:** *"Calm mission control desk with ultrawide monitor showing clean charts, glowing orbits, and data nodes in a dark room"*

### Prompt:

```
Create a wide hero illustration for a personal analytics portfolio. The scene is a calm "mission control" desk in a dark room, with a single ultrawide monitor showing clean charts and a few glowing orbits and nodes, like planets made of data. No people. Style: minimal, slightly 2.5D, similar to Stripe or Linear app marketing. Color palette: deep navy background, soft blue and teal accents, tiny magenta highlights. The UI on the screen should be abstract but readable: 2–3 simple line charts, a few tags or chips, and one large metric tile. Composition: roomy, with most detail in the center-right so text could sit on the left if needed. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
```

## 2. Invest_AI Visual — "ETF Constellation"

**Target:** `/public/images/projects/invest-ai/hero.webp`  
**Aspect Ratio:** 3:2 (1600×1067)  
**Alt Text:** *"Abstract constellation map showing ETF clusters as glowing nodes converging into a central portfolio signal"*  
**Caption:** *"Conceptual map of ETFs converging into one portfolio signal — built to make optimization feel less like magic and more like a teaching conversation."*

### Prompt:

```
Generate an abstract illustration for a project called "Invest_AI – ETF Portfolio Coach." Show a constellation made of tiny dots and lines forming clusters, each cluster representing ETFs, converging into one central glowing node labelled subtly "Portfolio." Style: sleek, data-driven, almost like a space map. Color palette: dark navy to black background, cyan and teal lines, soft white glow, a few orange highlights. No logos, no text except a tiny, unobtrusive "Invest_AI" label in the corner. Aspect ratio: 3:2.
```

### Gallery Images (optional, generate later):
- `dashboard.webp` — Three optimizer panels side-by-side
- `risk-profile.webp` — Eight-question risk assessment interface
- `portfolio.webp` — Monte Carlo corridor visualization

## 3. Unified Scraper Visual — "Pipes & Panels"

**Target:** `/public/images/projects/unified-scraper/hero.webp`  
**Aspect Ratio:** 3:2 (1600×1067)  
**Alt Text:** *"Diagram showing multiple website cards flowing through a clean pipeline into a unified analytics dashboard"*  
**Caption:** *"Multiple data sources flowing into a unified scraping pipeline — designed for reliability over speed, reproducibility over clever hacks."*

### Prompt:

```
Create a conceptual diagram-style illustration for a tool called "Unified Scraper." Show multiple simple website cards on the left flowing through a clean pipeline into a single analytics dashboard on the right. Represent the pipeline as smooth rounded rectangles and lines, not messy code. Style: flat, 2.5D product art, inspired by modern SaaS landing pages. Color palette: slate blue and charcoal with bright blue and green accents for "success." No real logos or brand names. Aspect ratio: 3:2.

**Caption:** *"Representing attention and cognitive load in digital products — built to reduce guilt and friction instead of just adding prettier lists."*

### Prompt:

```
Design an abstract illustration representing attention and cognitive load in digital products. Show a central human silhouette or simple head outline with multiple UI cards orbiting around it. Some cards look smooth and aligned, others jittered or faded to represent friction. Style: soft, friendly, and research-y, like an IDEO or Notion illustration. Color palette: warm coral, muted purple, and soft teal on a light background, with thin gray lines to give it a wireframe feel. No text. Aspect ratio: 4:3.
```

### Gallery Images (optional):

**Caption:** *"University network diagram — mapping buyer segments and engagement flows for campus hiring and early-career networking."*

### Prompt:

```
Create a clean illustration for a B2B SaaS case study about university networking and HR enablement. Show a stylized campus map or network graph: a few simple building icons connected to ID-card or profile icons, with arrows showing engagement flows. Style: flat, minimal, almost like a slide from a consulting deck. Color palette: light background, navy and charcoal for structure, one accent color (royal blue or teal) for highlights. No text or logos. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
```

### Secondary Image:
**Target:** `/public/images/case-studies/penpal-b2b/secondary.webp`  
**Alt Text:** *"Journey flow diagram showing phased adoption from students to universities"*  
**Caption:** *"Phased pilot framework: students first to prove engagement, then universities once usage data validated the model."*

**Alt Text:** *"Abstract dashboard showing cohort retention curves and pricing model comparisons"*  
**Caption:** *"Retention segmentation and pricing playbook — balancing ARPU growth with churn control through structured experimentation."*

### Prompt:

```
Create an abstract dashboard illustration for a video SaaS retention and pricing case study. Show cohort retention curves (line charts) and side-by-side pricing model comparisons (subscription vs. hybrid bundles). Style: clean, data-focused, like a Tableau or Looker dashboard but simplified. Color palette: white background, slate gray structure, blue and teal for positive metrics, subtle orange for warnings. No brand logos or identifiable UI elements. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
```

**Usage:** Optional overlay for light mode sections

### Prompt:

```
Create a seamless, very light background pattern for a portfolio site with a "wireframe newsletter" feel. Graph-paper style: thin gray lines forming a 16px grid, with a few random dotted construction lines and small crosshair marks, all at very low opacity so text is still perfectly legible. Color palette: off-white paper (#fafaf8) with #e0e0e0 lines at 10–15% opacity. No logos, no text. Aspect ratio: 1:1 tileable.
```

## Workflow

1. **Generate** each visual using the prompts above with DALL·E, Midjourney, or Copilot Designer
2. **Export** at specified resolution as `.webp` (preferred) or `.png`
3. **Place** files in the target directories:
   - `/public/images/hero/mission-control.webp`
   - `/public/images/projects/invest-ai/hero.webp`
   - `/public/images/projects/unified-scraper/hero.webp`
   - `/public/images/projects/neurodivulge/hero.webp`
   - `/public/images/case-studies/penpal-b2b/hero.webp`
   - `/public/images/case-studies/svc-retention-pricing/hero.webp`
   - `/public/images/case-studies/perry-pricing-analytics/hero.webp`
4. **Verify** by running `npm run build` — all `next/image` components should load correctly
5. **Optional:** Generate gallery/secondary images later using similar style guidelines

---

## Notes

- All alt text and captions are already configured in `src/data/projects.ts` and `src/data/case-studies.ts`
- The site will fall back to placeholder frames if images are missing
- Once images are dropped in, no code changes needed — `next/image` will handle optimization
- Keep style consistent: minimal, 2.5D, grown-up, data-focused (not playful/childish)
- Dark mode visuals should have dark backgrounds; light mode case studies can use lighter backgrounds
- Avoid text in images unless it's part of the UI/dashboard mockup (keep it abstract and readable)

---

**Status:** Ready for image generation. Drop files in, build, deploy.
